The New York State Teachers' Association

WHAT IS A PROFESSIONAL TEACHER?

ONE who is interested in her profession as well as in her "job"; who helps to raise and maintain the conditions of school service. Standards of preparation and pay, and to improve the systems of support and control of schools don't just happen to exist. School laws affecting almost every phase of teaching work don't come like the rain. The overhead of carnet and persistent effort ining a profession is the product of carnet and persistent effort. Group benefits demand group service. Every teacher and fort. Group benefits demand group service. Every teacher and receives benefits from others' service to the profession and to each other's benefits. Not each for each, but each for all and all for each is the professional spirit.

WHAT THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR

Our Association was largely instrumental in securing the passage of the so-called Dick-Rice Law. This is one of the most important pieces of educational legislation in recent years.

First, the new law provides for additional State aid for schools by extending the principle of the Cole Law passed two years ago. The amount of this additional State aid is $16,500,000 in 1927, and increases approximately five additional millions in each year for the next three, amounting in 1930 to about $32,000,000.

New York State Teachers' Association

Second, the new law distributes this money on an equitable basis, first, by determining the number of pupils in the community; and second, by determining the wealth of each community on the basis of the full valuation of real property. The State sets a minimum educational program which each community must reach. In return, it guarantees each community enough money to meet this requirement if the community makes a fair contribution toward it.

Third, under the old Cole law the State provided $1,200 for each cost unit in elementary schools, and $1,600 for each cost unit in secondary schools. Under the new law these amounts are raised to $1,500 and $1,900 respectively in all schools having more than five teachers. For schools having two, three, and four teachers, an additional quota of $200 a year is provided.

Fourth, the law is sound, in that it provides for the gradual raising of the standard of education by requiring all communities of the State to reach a higher minimum expenditure per pupil, and secondly, by distributing the cost of the State's minimum program of education upon all communities in proportion to their ability to pay taxes. This applies to the smallest and poorest community, as well as to the largest and wealthiest in the State. New York City gets no more and no less on this basis than any other community in the State.

RETIREMENT LAW AMENDMENTS

Several important amendments to the Retirement Law were passed last winter.

One of these provides that leave of absence with pay may be considered "service" under regulations prescribed by the Retirement Board. Under the original law, this was not the case. The amendment is to the advantage of the teacher, since it may happen that leave of absence may need to be counted to make up the years necessary either for disability or superannuated retirement. In case this time is not so needed, it is not necessary to include it; and, therefore, the teacher's average annual salary is not affected by the smaller amount of pay received during leave of absence, when the retirement allowance is being determined.

A second amendment provides that the teacher who is absent from school duties for more than two years because of serious illness, but who has not had sufficient service to retire because of disability—for example, a total of thirteen years—will not automatically lose her membership in the system, but upon application to the Retirement Board will be continued indefinitely as a member, or until such time as her health recovers.

Announcement for 1927-28

Sixth, it has been the practice of the Retirement Board, under a bylaw provision, to require an interval of thirty days between the time of application for retirement and the actual beginning of the retirement allowance. This practice has resulted in litigation in two or three instances, and the board always had been sustained. The amendment to the law, therefore, recognizes beyond question this thirty-day period. This amendment is to the advantage of members of the system in general. It has been pointed out that the reason for this thirty-day limit is a financial one as well as the evident intent of the original statute. If members who become ill suddenly, apply for retirement, taking an option insuring their lives in favor of a beneficiary, and die within a few days, the fund would suffer greatly by the payment of large sums of money to persons who were never teachers. When the retirement law was drawn, calculations were made on the basis of allowing thirty days before claims became effective. A careful estimate by Dr. Buck, the actuary who was responsible for the drafting of the retirement law, gives the probable increased annual cost to the system as $590,000, if such thirty-day rule were not applied. To meet such an increased cost, considerably larger contributions would have to be made both by teachers and communities.

A law was also passed at the last session of the Legislature which increases the salary of each district superintendent to $3,000, and which requires such superintendents to be college graduates, with at least three years' experience in teaching or supervision.

SOME OF THE THINGS THE ASSOCIATION HAS STOOD FOR AND SEeks TO FULLY ATTAIN ARE

1. Superior schools for superior citizenship.
2. Equality of educational opportunity.
3. An adequately trained teacher in every school-room.
4. Efficient administration and supervision for all schools.
5. Adequate school buildings and equipment.
6. Equality of school cost for all citizens.
7. Salary standards commensurate with service standards.
8. Safeguarded tenure.
9. Protection of the schools from partisan and personal politics.
10. Satisfactory living conditions for teachers.
11. Adequate provision for retired teachers.
12. A spirit of democracy throughout school service.

New York State Teachers' Association

13. Association of teachers for professional and social benefits.
14. Close co-operation between the school and the home and other social agencies of education.
15. Whatever makes for better schools.

The New York State Teachers' Association is democratic in character and spirit, and is organized for efficient service economically rendered.

WHAT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION?

The membership 1926-27 is 37,000. This is an enrollment of teachers—with statewide outlook and interest—in the public schools of New York State.

WHAT IS THE PLAN OF ENROLLMENT?

The plan is to enroll teachers in the State Association. The dues are based on the salary received, and the price of enrollment entitles the members to the New York State Teachers' Association Journal (New York State Education). Enrollment is for the year starting November 1, 1927, to November 1, 1928.

DISTRICT OFFICERS AND MEETINGS

In order to bring an annual meeting of our Association within the reach of the attendance of every member, the House of Delegates has adopted a zoning system whereby the State is divided into seven zones or districts.

Announcement for 1927-28

Why I Should Join the New York State Teachers' Association

To have a part in statewide legislation, publicity and co-operation; to receive the information and inspiration in the New York State Teachers' Association Journal (New York State Education); to enjoy the fellowship of professional association; in short, to be professional.

If you are a younger teacher you have much to learn, if you are an older teacher you have much to give. A part in the New York State Teachers' Association program is both a privilege and an obligation.

"The Department of Public Instruction believes that the reorganization of the State Association is the most important step ever taken by the Teachers of this State." (A. M. Deyoe, State Supt. of Public Instruction, Iowa.)

"Let us realize that if we do not ORGANIZE more compactly for professional ends, we shall never gain the advantages which come from united action. If we act as individuals we are like the single fagot, easily broken by the naked hand. If we bind ourselves together we shall be strong." (Prof. C. H. Judd, University of Chicago.)

"Are you a member of your STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION? should be asked by every board of education and by every school director in the State—of applicants for teaching positions." (Supt. M. G. Clark, Sioux City, President Iowa State Teachers' Association.)

"I believe that there is no more important question before us than the reorganization of the teaching profession. It is primary to all wholesome and substantial success." (Prof. Henry Suzzalo, Pres. University of Washington.)

The New York State Teachers' Association is the professional family of the teachers of the State. It was organized in its present form, in 1845, in the belief that they were possessed of enough common interests to justify an attempt to work out their purposes in a body.

Other professions do so. Lawyers and doctors are civic factors to be reckoned with because of unity of effort. Manufacturers, merchants and laborers co-operate for their common ends. By various forms of association control,
