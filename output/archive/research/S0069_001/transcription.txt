**DEAR MR. KROHN:**

Your letter of October 16, 1968 has been referred to me for reply.

We have no papers covering the organization of Union Free School District #7 of Augusta, etc. However, that is not unusual because many records were destroyed in the Capitol fire of 1911. Our only source of information is a book compiled by Sara L. Gardiner December 31, 1922. Information in this book is very reliable and I am quoting from this book: "Many Falls Union Free School admitted to the University of the State of New York thru Regents Action March 19, 1896. Graduated as the Stoughton High School in 1893."

I trust this information will meet your need.

Very truly yours,

**Irma A. Wikie**
**Senior Audit Clerk**
