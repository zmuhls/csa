The New York State Teachers' Association

of all the teachers in these revenue and salary campaigns ahead of us and in our other campaigns for the welfare of teachers and children and the good of the schools in general. NO teacher can afford NOT to be a MEMBER of the State Association.

The Association will use its influence to promote the passage of a law giving administrative independence to school boards so that boards may determine the amount and collect the resources necessary for a successful administration of school systems and may enable them to pay teachers a just compensation without restriction by municipal authorities.

It will work for the passage of a law which will protect the present State quotas for teachers and, if possible, to secure increased and equitable distribution of State assistance in the financial support of schools.

The Association proposes to find out what the local and rural authorities wish and to assist in securing such legislation as the rural school authorities feel is needed.

To secure the passage of a law which will place all health education, including medical inspection and school nursing, entirely under the jurisdiction of educational authorities rather than under the control of boards of health.

To do everything possible to secure better living conditions for teachers both in the city and rural communities.

To co-operate in every way possible with the State Department of Education in the securing of a higher standard of professional training for teachers and thereby increase the efficiency of our schools.

To secure the enactment of laws which will bring about increased compensation and higher professional consideration for teachers.

The New York State Teachers' Association

WHY EVERY TEACHER SHOULD JOIN THE STATE ASSOCIATION

Since there are several thousand teachers who have not yet joined our Association, we feel that they should carefully consider the reasons why it is their duty to join our organization.

1. Because group and class organization is now considered absolutely necessary and the New York State Teachers' Association is the only big all inclusive teacher organization of the State. This is an age of organization and organized effort. The successful carrying out of our program is possible only by the co-operation of all the teachers of the State. Nothing big or important can be accomplished in these days except through organization and co-operation. If the teachers of the State are to perform all their duties and functions as teachers, and command the respect of other professions and other organized classes, they must have a strong and active organization functioning as a State unit.

2. Because it helps in a professional way. The zone or district meetings will furnish excellent programs on professional topics. Educational addresses will be delivered by great leaders. In-spiring addresses will be discussed by experts. Our Journal goes to all members ten times a year to keep them informed concerning the problems, program and activities of the Association. The esprit de corps thus developed in the teachers enables them to work more happily and efficiently. When we have 100% attendance at the meetings, we shall be able to stay outside. No teacher can afford to stay outside. When we have 100% in our membership, we shall be able to secure any and all reasons able consideration for the teachers' welfare.

New York State as a whole is certainly responding nobly to the demand for more money for teaching. But we must be ready with the reaction now setting in and we must be with strong organization to meet it. Attendance at the meetings promotes closer acquaintance and good fellowship among teachers who are otherwise widely separated. [stamp: New York State Teachers' Association]
