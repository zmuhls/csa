TO THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION:

It would give me great pleasure to contribute something of more value, but my time is so occupied at present, that I must confine myself to the earnest expression of my interest in your work. Please accept my best wishes for continued success and prosperity.

Yours very sincerely,

MARY E. WILKINS.
