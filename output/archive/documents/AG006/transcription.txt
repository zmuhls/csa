**Announcement for 1927-28**

3. Because of the effective service which, since its organization, it has rendered to the New York State teacher in privileges, security, and salary, fresh insights into education.

4. Because of the present need for concerted action to further improve teaching conditions, and to stimulate public co-operation in the way of published proceedings, monographs and bulletins of the New York State Education subscription and a central office of information.

5. Because of the small expense, the large professional advantages of such membership, in the way of published proceedings, monographs and bulletins of the New York State Education subscription and a central office of information.

These five items are an inventory only of the more obvious advantages of co-operative effort through the New York State Teachers' Association, that should enroll a 100% membership of the New York State teachers, and expect more loyal support in money and time, and contributions of material.

"Thirty-seven thousand New York State teachers know that it pays."

"In other fields a very much shorter period of training results in much larger rewards. It is not because we would argue in favor of increasing salaries for teachers. It is because we believe that the nation cannot afford to have any but the best trained men and women in the school rooms. It is only because we hope to place in every school room a better teacher. It is only because we believe that the nation cannot afford to have any but the best trained men and women in the school rooms. It is only because we believe that the nation cannot afford to have any but the best trained men and women in the school rooms. It is only because we believe that the nation cannot afford to have any but the best trained men and women in the school rooms."

"The people themselves and their representatives in tax-levying bodies need to do investment of popular wealth so large dividends in material wealth is not to be pleased as a reason for withholding the means of education rather as read on to them in larger proportion."

"Hon. P. P. Claxon, U. Commissioner."

Announcement for 1927-28

probably be made in many parts of the State during the next year. Of course your Association will do everything possible and honorable to prevent such reduction. In fact, the Association will work for further increases rather than decreases because salaries for good teachers have never been sufficient and never will be too high. We shall need the support and co-operation of all the teachers in these revenue and salary campaigns ahead of us and in our other campaigns for the welfare of teachers and children and the good of the schools in general. NO teacher can afford NOT to be a MEMBER of the State Association.

The Association will use its influence to promote the passage of a law which will pro- tect the present State quotas for teachers and, if possible, to secure increased and equitable distribution of State asistance in the financial support of schools. The Association proposes to find out what the local and rural authorities wish and to assist in securing such legisla- tion as the rural school authorities feel is needed. It will work for the passage of a law giving administrative independence to school boards so that boards may determine the amount and collect the resources necessary for a successful administra- tion of school systems and may enable them to pay teachers a just compensation without restriction by municipal authorities.

To secure the passage of a law which will place all health education, including medical inspection and school nursing, entirely under the jurisdiction of educational authorities rather than under the control of boards of health.
