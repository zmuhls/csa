WHAT THE STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION PROPOSES TO DO FOR THE TEACHERS
OF NEW YORK STATE

Many people are beginning to talk about deflation, retrenchment and so on, and there are always powerful influences at work to reduce taxation. So an effort will probably be made in many parts of the State to reduce salaries during the next year. Of course your Association will do everything possible and honorable to prevent any such reduction. In fact, the Association will do everything possible and honorable to prevent any such reduction. In fact, the Association will work for further increases rather than decreases because salaries for good teachers have never been sufficient and never will be too high.
