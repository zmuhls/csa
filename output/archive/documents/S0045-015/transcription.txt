N. Y. S. Teachers' Association 85

they were scarcely opened when they were assailed by the professed friends of education, generally in the interest of the private academies. So powerful did this opposition become that Governor Lucius Robinson, in his annual message to the Legislature of this State, recommended "an inquiry as to whether the normal schools are really worth to the system of education what they cost." He said that he had been informed that a very large portion of the pupils instructed in them never follow the profession of teaching any length of time. The whole subject was very thoroughly discussed, and great effort was made by the enemies of this class of schools to prove that they were not worth what they cost.

State Superintendent Gilmour instituted a most rigid inquiry into the whole question, and the result of his investigation was most satisfactory to those who believed in the value of normal school training, for it made the highest efficiency of the schools more secure in public favor than ever. He did not think, however, that the normal schools more efficient could be attained while other than normal courses were permitted in them, and so he issued an order on June 11, 1877, discontinuing the academic departments in all the normal schools where they were found, except in Fredonia, where a school expressly establishing that school expressly upheld it. Superintendent Gilmour afterward suspended the operation of his order in the case of Brockport and Potsdam, because of certain equities claimed by these schools. In his report to the Legislature he requested that body to appoint a committee to investigate and report upon this and other matters pertaining to these schools. The Legislature complied and appointed a committee, which committee made a report concerning these academic departments. The Legislature, as a result of this report, requested the superintendent to revoke his order discontinuing such departments in the remaining schools, which he accordingly did.

I do not speak by authority, but I infer from some statements that I have heard made by authority, that, had it not been for the equities involved, which could not be disregarded in the case of a number of the normal schools, the Commissioner of Education would have discontinued these departments in all of these schools in the recent reorganization of them, instead of forming out of them model high schools. I think that there is no friend of the normal schools who is not willing to admit that a very substantial argument could be presented for such a course on the ground of professional efficiency.

And so the normal schools have continued from the day of the foundation of the first until now, meeting with opposition bitter and persistent, with failures incident to the development of any system, but doing their work so satisfactorily as to convert enemies into friends, and even ardent supporters, and sending out a product for which the demand is constantly increasing. Whether the charge that a large number of the graduates of normal schools never do any teaching that was a just one year ago, I do not know. I believe, however, that it was false, having no foundation except in the imaginations of ill-informed or prejudiced tracers. This I do know, that for fourteen years, at least, 98 per cent. of the graduates of one normal school have found their way into the school rooms of this and other States as teachers. I am confident that this is true of all.

The New York Normal School is not claimed, by its most earnest defender, to be all that it ought to be, but it has done much to help forever the value of professional training for teachers. It may not be ideal either in organization or conduct, but the fact that the supply of its graduates has not been equal to the demand for them is good proof that it has done much to meet the expectations of those responsible for its existence, and that it has done and is doing much to increase the efficiency of the teaching service of the State.

Training for Efficiency
BY SUPPT. D. L. BARWELL, NEW YORK CITY.

When President Slawson sent me an invitation to prepare and present an address to this body, I was anxious to accept both because of personal friendship with Mr. Slawson and because I felt that there was something which I would like to say to those whose business it is to train teachers for the public schools. Mr. Slawson's invitation lay on my desk for a couple of days, during which I was too busy to give more than a moment's thought to the particular theme which I should present. This brief statement will explain the very general nature of the title to this paper. No criticism of the work or purpose of those who are training teachers was intended or indeed thought of. I understand perfectly
