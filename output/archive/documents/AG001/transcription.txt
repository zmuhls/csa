The New York State Teachers' Association

WHAT IS THE PLAN OF ENROLLMENT?
The plan is to enroll teachers in the State Association. The dues are based on the salary received, and the price of enrollment entitles the members to the New York State Teachers' Association Journal (New York State Education). Enrollment is for the year starting November 1, 1926, to November 1, 1927.

[Support Your Profession; It Supports You]

WHY SHOULD I JOIN THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION?

To have a part in statewide legislation, publicity and co-operation; to receive the information and inspiration in the New York State Teachers' Association Journal (New York State Education); to enjoy the fellowship of professional association; in short, to be professional.

If you are a younger teacher you have much to learn, if you are an older teacher you have much to give. A part in the New York State Teachers' Association program is both a privilege and an obligation.

"The Department of Public Instruction believes that the reorganization of the State Association is the most important step ever taken by the Teachers of this State." (A. M. Deyoe, State Sup't. of Public Instruction, Iowa.)

"Let us realize that if we do not ORGANIZE more compactly for professional ends, we shall never gain the advantages which come from united action. If we act as individuals we are like the single fagot easily broken by the naked hand. If we bind ourselves together we shall be strong." (Prof. C. H. Judd, University of Chicago.)

"Are you a member of your STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION? should be asked by every board of education and every school director in the State—of applicants for teaching positions." (Supt. M. G. Clark, Sioux City, President Iowa State Teachers' Association.)

"I believe that there is no more important question before us than the reorganization of the teaching profession. It is primary to all wholesome and substantial success." (Prof. Henry Suzzalo, Pres. University of Washington.)

The New York State Teachers' Association is the professional family of the teachers of the State. It was organized in its

The New York State Teachers' Association

2. Because of the stimulating influence upon one of an interested membership in an organization of his co-workers.
3. Because of the effective service which, since its organization, it has rendered to the New York State teacher, in privileges, security, salary, and fresh insights into education.
4. Because of the present need for concerted action to further improve teaching conditions, and to stimulate public co-operation.
5. Because of the small expense and the large professional advantages of such membership, in the way of published proceedings, monographs and bulletins, the New York State Education subscription and a central office of information.

These five items are an inventory only of the more obvious advantages of cooperative effort through the New York State Teachers Association, that should enroll a 100% membership of the New York State teachers. Nowhere else has a central organization reason to expect more loyal support in money and time, and contributions of material, Thirty-four thousand New York State teachers know that it pays.

"In other fields a very much shorter period of training results in much larger rewards. It is not because we would argue in favor of increasing our own salaries that we hope to place in every school room a better teacher. It is only because we believe that the nation cannot afford to have any better trained men and women in the school rooms that we would argue for more money for the support of our teachers."—George D. Strayer, Claxton, U. S. Commissioner.

"The people themselves and their representatives in tax-levying bodies need so large dividends in material wealth as do investors in popular education; and that comparative poverty is not to be shown that no other use of investment field so large as the means of education is not as a reason for withholding the means of education, but rather as a reason for supplying them in larger proportion."—Hon. P. P.
