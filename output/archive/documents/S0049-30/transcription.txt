insidious, and therefore the most dangerous, foe of the Republic
is the man whose politics or whose religion, whose ignorance or
whose selfishness, leads him, deliberately or unwittingly, to thwart
the best results of its high and holy mission.

I thank you for your patience; it has seemed boundless. For
all your thoughtful and considerate courtesy I make my most
respectful acknowledgments; it encumbers the State Superin-
tendent with obligations which he has no power to repay save
in sincere and grateful appreciation.

Note.—Investigations, incident to the preparation of the foregoing address, have
led me to think that an exhibit showing the extent and manner of school supervision
which has been in operation in this State since the organization of the school super-
vision together with a complete list of State superintendents, and a statement indicat-
ing the places of meeting, and the presiding officers at the various sessions of the
different State associations, would be acceptable to the educators of the State, and I
take the liberty of adding the same in a brief appendix. I also embrace the opportu-
nity to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. C. W. Bardeen, of Syracuse, who kindly
lent me generously from his private library rare books and documents which have
been of great assistance, not only in supplying this added information, but in the
preparation of the address itself.
