THE PURPOSE of this book, which is the product of five years of research conducted by the Committee on the Community School of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, is to present a comprehensive view of the community school movement in the United States during the past decade. The committee has attempted to describe the origins of the community school movement, its development in various states, and its present status. The committee has also attempted to analyze the psychological and social foundations of recent years which provide a sound basis for the further expansion of the community school movement.

The book begins with three frankly ideated, on the basis of past experience, what a genuine community school might do in a small rural area, in a small town, in a large city, and in an interurban area. The committee has attempted to guide the reader through the process of establishing a community school in each of these four cases. Each case is reported and interpreted in detail, with a discussion of the problems encountered and the solutions found. Within each of these categories four case histories are presented, each one dealing with a community school which is sufficiently advanced in its development to provide a sound basis for future expansion of the community school movement.

The true case histories are grouped in three categories: the first dealing with schools that are just beginning to deal with the community in their progress; the second dealing with schools that are just beginning to deal with the community in their progress; and the third dealing with schools which are sufficiently advanced in their development to provide a sound basis for future expansion of the community school movement.

In the final part of the book an attempt is made to analyze the psychological and social foundations of recent years which provide a sound basis for the further expansion of the community school movement. The text is followed by a very useful bibliography of pertinent books, pamphlets, and motion pictures.

Many of the most important and distinguished leaders in education have collaborated in the preparation of this important volume. The book is a tribute to the contributions of researchers, writers, critics, and editors in the field of community school education.
