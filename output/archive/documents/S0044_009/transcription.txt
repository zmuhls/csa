A community council is formed...

A community council is formed from representatives from more than forty community organizations, including religious groups, veterans groups, well-established groups, and others. It has been particularly helpful in bringing inter-agency problems to the attention of leaders in the work of the school. Good schools become better when they use their resources to work with other agencies in their communities.

The community school not only gets help from other agencies—it helps them. The school responds to the needs of the community by, for example, providing a central location for the public library, which is expanding its services to surrounding areas. The school provides a site on its grounds for the services of its vocational education staff. Various groups ask for rooms for their meetings, study, and recreation. The school building is kept open all the evenings so that responsible groups can use it.

Often the school discovers the need for a new agency in the community. One such council consists of selectmen, freeholders, trustees, and other community leaders. The council might start by forming a league with the school. At the same time, the community school does not depend upon the school for all its services. It keeps its many activities for all age groups, which might otherwise be carried out away from the school. At the basis of the community school is mutual understanding among the agencies. It is not taking on functions that might be better carried out by some other agency. The basis of the community school is cooperation.

The school that knows about the other agencies in its community knows how to make use of their services. Often specific agencies on certain problems.
