Schools Must Be Patterned to Fit
Broad Program, Retiring Expert Says

By LAVINA REEDY

The modern version of the little red schoolhouse is the most important tool in education out
there. That's the opinion of Dr. Wil
William Wilson, who has served as State
Superintendent of Schools for the last 22 years. During his tenure, Dr. Wilson has helped
the school districts throughout the state with their building problems.

Dr. Wilson says the only excuse for the existence of the school building is the service it
provides for its pupils and that today's buildings must fit to the broadening educational
program.

He says an old-fashioned class
room with five or six rows of eight
stationary seats with a teacher at the
front of the room is no longer an
adequate setup. "I think that now
like that just teaches only the three
Rs," he says.

The educational plant plan
should have movable furniture
that can be arranged in small
groups. It should have storage
space, visual education facil
ities, display space for chil
dren's work, food lighting and
attractive decorations using
color and pictures.

To develop a child physically,
emotionally, spiritually and so
cially, it takes more than just
indoors. Play, recreation, an
assembly room, attractive
gymnasiums, libraries and other
group activities as part of the
school site. It takes playgrounds
and the auditorium each day
and from the cafeteria to the
auditorium to encourage reading
and an appreciation of music.
