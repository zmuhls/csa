Do We Earn What We Get?

Let us now turn to the other side of the picture. Do we as teachers earn what we get? Bluntly, do we merit the compensation, the security of position, the protection and safeguarding in old age, the social recognition and the public confidence which we enjoy? It is a question we must be not only willing but able to answer. The answer is to be found perhaps mainly in our basic education, in the degree of our specific training, in the enterprise we render for our calling, in the quality of the service we show in improving the quality of our common school education. It is a question which we must keep abreast of the growing science of education.

Education and Training

The first consideration in determining whether or not we earn what we get turns upon our individual fitness. How well are we educated, and what specific preparation have we had for the practice of the intricate art of teaching? The notion that one who knows and understands can readily instruct others has not died upon the earth. It still dominates the performance called teaching in many college classrooms, and has yet been completely routed from the public schools. The notion that one who has knowledge and power may improve his ability to communicate that knowledge to others through a study of means and methods and through practice under guidance is comparatively new. Time was not long since when school teaching was an employment like clerking in a grocery ployment like clerking in a grocery store or driving a village bus; and the employment sought was the one which promised the most with the least expenditure of effort.
