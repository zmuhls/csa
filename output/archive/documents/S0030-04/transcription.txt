Why Every Teacher Should Join the State Association

1. Because group and class organization is now considered absolutely necessary and the New York State Teachers' Association is the only big, all-inclusive teacher organization of the State. This is an age of organization.

Since there are several thousand teachers who have yet not joined our Association, we feel that they should carefully consider the reasons why it is their duty to join our organization.
