The image provided is a typed document, not a handwritten one. Therefore, it does not require transcription in the style of 19th-century American handwriting. However, I can provide a transcription of the typed text as it appears in the image:

**September 19, 1941**

Mr. John C. Malloch  
District Superintendent of Schools  
Churchville, New York  

My dear John;

When and if we get around to preparing a history of the New York State Teachers Association we shall need all the documentary material we can get and anything you send will be appreciated.

The name of the plastic used to match up the steps is Farnec Waterproofing and Cowboy sand. We secured it from the John B. Malloch, Inc. builders of Albany (400 Second Street).

Very sincerely yours,

AVIE ELDRED,  
Executive Secretary

If you have a specific handwritten document that you would like transcribed, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist with that as well.
