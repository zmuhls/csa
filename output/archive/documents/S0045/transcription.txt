**SCHOOLS ARE BIG BUSINESS**

For example, the school district of one typical Midwestern city of 100,000 population has a capital investment in its school plant of $9,315,924, employs a total personnel of 663, and spends each year approximately $3,410,177 for current operation. No single business firm in this city can match these figures. The same thing will hold true, with few exceptions, in communities of every size throughout our land.

It should follow, then, that merely from a business standpoint, the job of superintendent of schools is one of the biggest administrative jobs in the community. In some areas, the superintendent of schools is responsible for transporting more individuals each day than all public transportation services combined. He is often responsible for school lunchrooms serving more people than all the hotels and restaurants combined. He is always responsible for safeguarding the health and well-being of a larger segment of the population than ever falls at one time under the care of all the area's social agencies combined. When we add to such physical and material aspects a consideration of the enduring human values which we expect to evolve from the educational process, the importance of the responsibility resting upon the superintendent becomes even more apparent.

and ear by always putting important examples of the oral work on the
third. Latin composition is not a problem in itself, but is an index of the
freedom that has characterized the student's preparation in the
language. If he has been trained to read closely and accurately, after a
quick and accurate knowledge of forms, that student will write simple
Latin well. This really all that the colleges ask for. The writing of
connected narrative, more less figurative and involved, does not belong
to the secondary school.

The Development of the New York State Normal School

BY FRANCIS J. CHENEY, CORTLAND NORMAL SCHOOL.

To most of you it is, without doubt, a familiar story I have to tell,
and yet may not be without profit to repeat it.

The normal school as an institution has existed less than 300 years.
The first organization for the training of teachers, of which we have any
account, believed to have been established by La Salle at Reims, in about
the year 1683. A few years after the efforts of La Salle to furnish an
opportunity to those who wished to prepare themselves for teaching,
Augustus Hermann Ranke established a teachers' class at Halle, in
Prussia. He provided free board for such poor students as stood in need
of assistance, and selected out of the whole number twelve who exhibited
the right basis of piety, knowledge, skill and desire for teaching, and
constituted them his "Seminarium Preceptorium," or teachers' Seminary.
These pupil teachers received instruction for two years in methods, and,
in return, promised to teach for three years in the institution after
nishing their course. So successful was this work, that it is said, hundreds
of teachers were attracted from all parts of Europe to observe and study
the organization, methods and spirit of the school.

Other classes for teachers were opened in other parts of Germany.
Courses of lectures on the best methods of teaching German and the
ancient languages became common in the universities and higher schools
of Germany. From Germany the system spread to other parts of Europe;
but the normal school idea, we understand it, made little headway until
the beginning of the nineteenth century.

It is a mooted question how far these efforts in Europe to train
teachers influenced the normal school idea in the United States. Some
contend that they had no influence upon us whatever, as the earliest
advocates of the normal school in this country knew little or nothing of
what had been done in Europe. Although the seed was planted here as
early as 1816, it required time to take root. In that year a young man,
Denison Olmstead by name, a native of Connecticut, when writing his
oration for his master's degree took for his subject, [stamp: N.Y.S. Teachers' Association]

"The Ignorance and Incapacity of Schoolmasters." In this oration he advocated the establishment of an "Academy for Schoolmasters." The idea continued to grow abroad as well as at home. Dr. Barnard affirms that to Mr. Carter, who is sometimes called the "Father of Normal Schools" in this country, more than to any other one person belongs the credit of having arrested the leading minds of Massachusetts to the necessity of the immediate and thorough improvement in the system of free schools, and of having clearly pointed out the most direct and thorough mode of procuring this improvement by providing for the training of competent teachers for these schools.

Mr. Carter was a member of the Massachusetts Legislature and chairman of the Committee on Education. This position made it possible for him to do much toward creating a public opinion in favor of normal schools in Massachusetts, which resulted in the Normal School Act of 1839 in that State.

The movement in favor of normal schools was greatly aided by the letters published in the Connecticut Observer, a newspaper printed in Hartford, from the pen of the Rev. Thomas Gallaudet. These letters favored the project of professional training of teachers, and proposed methods of anticipating difficulties.

Other States took up the idea—as Pennsylvania, Tennessee and far off Missouri. As early as 1826, Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York, in his annual message to the Legislature of the State, strongly recommended the establishment of a seminary for the training of teachers.

It is said that the first practical work of a professional nature in this country was done by Samuel B. Hall, at Concord, Vt, where he opened a school for the training of teachers.

The first regular normal school, however, in America was the one established at Lexington, Mass, under the Act of 1839, already mentioned. This school received the hearty endorsement and able assistance of Horace Mann, who had just been appointed secretary of the recently established Board of Education. The enterprise might not have been successful had it not received the aid of its brilliant talents and untiring devotion on the 3rd of July, 1839, with three pupils, and Cyrus Pierce as principal. The school was organized entirely fitting that a school of this character, whose purpose is to prepare teachers the better for their great work of training good citizens, should have deeds of those who sealed their devotion to free institutions with their blood. It took a strong man to meet the difficulties incident to the lodgment of a new idea in the public mind. The cause of normal schools in this country on such suggestive a day and in a place hallowed by the blood of those who sealed their devotion to free institutions with their blood. It took a strong man to meet the difficulties incident to the lodgment of a new idea in the public mind. The cause of normal schools in this country may be inferred from the fact that it is still in existence on Framingham, which place much owes to Principal Pierce. That placed still in existence on Framingham, which place much owes to Principal Pierce. That placed still in existence on Framingham, which place much owes to Principal Pierce.

Proceedings of the

the Hon. Abram B. Weaver, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, issued a circular whose provisions were common to the five normal schools most recently established. In this circular he prescribed three courses of study: an elementary English course of two years, an advanced English course of four years. In each of these courses three years was practically given to professional work, and the remainder of the time devoted to subject matter.

The schools maintained, in general, two departments: A normal department and a practice school, the latter consisting of primary, intermediate and academic grades.

The normal schools that were established, subsequently, under general and special acts, were organized on the same plan. In 1886 a normal school was located at New Paltz, in 1889 another at Oneonta, in 1890 another at Plattsburgh, and in 1897 still another at Jamaica. In 1891 a so-called scientific course was added, consisting of the same subjects as the advanced English, with the addition of two years of Latin and two years of either French, German or Greek.

In 1892, on the recommendation of the normal school principals, the elementary English course was abolished. The remaining three were continued until 1900, when the scientific course was dropped. The English course lengthened to four years, the classical course somewhat modified, and two two-year courses, English and classical, for high school graduates, were added.

Along with the unification of our educational departments has come another change resulting in a general reorganization of the normal schools in this State. They now consist of a training school, a model high school and a normal or professional school proper. The training school is made up of all the grades below the high school, in many instances including the kindergarten department.

In the high school there are three courses of study, each four years in length.

The first course is intended for those who wish to enter the normal or professional school, and is open to any resident of the State who wishes to prepare for teaching, and who does not reside in a district where a high school is already established.

The second prepares for admission to college, and the third for admission to schools of technology. These last two are open to students only who live within the limits of the corporation where the normal school which they attend is located.

Students, however, who wish to take the normal school preparatory course for admission to the normal can do so; instead of the first course mentioned.

Candidates for admission to the normal school must be at least sixteen years of age, and must present a high school diploma, or its equivalent, as approved by the Commissioner of Education. Beginning with September, 1907, candidates must present a diploma showing that they have graduated from the course of study prescribed by the Commissioner of Education for admission to normal schools and city training schools under the provisions of Chapter 1031, Laws of 1895.

Persons who are twenty-one years of age, and have had two years of high school work, or its equivalent, and have also taught two years, will be admitted to the normal school, but must complete the high school course in addition to the professional course before they can be graduated.

Persons who hold training class certificates, having entered the training from the training class, and who have taught one year since graduating, and who have shown, by their work, that they show the required aptitude for training.

The professional or normal school course, proper, is a two year course, consisting of observation and practice work. There is also a kindergarten course of the same length for such of the schools as conduct a kindergarten department.

These courses have not been in operation long enough to prove their value as compared with that of the courses which they have displaced. One thing indicated will need no other experience to give him an adequate idea of the strenuous life.

Such is the history of the development of the New York Normal School. It has had to fight its way. It has great opposition. Had it not had able and influential friends the chances of its survival would have been remote. When there was but one normal school no opposition was manifest, but when seven additional schools were established
