The image provided does not appear to be a historical document from the New York State Common School system (1800s-1900s). Instead, it seems to be a modern document discussing a study related to school construction and planning in the City of New York, dated August 1951. Therefore, it does not align with the transcription rules you've specified for historical Common School documents.

However, if you would like me to transcribe this document according to the rules you've provided, I can do so. Please confirm if this is the document you wish to transcribe, or if you have a different historical document in mind.
