**EDUCATION IN REVIEW**  
*Growing Need for More School Facilities Is Highlighted by a New York Survey*  
By BENJAMIN FINE  

Greatly increased school enrollments over 250,000 in the past year have placed serious strains on various sections of the rooms in use. Over the past two years 750 new classrooms have been built, but 78,000 new class-rooms are needed to care for the enrollment increases. This left 10,000 plus normal teaching facilities, and all increases in the elementary grades. A concrete example of what last year's overcrowding came to light last week in this city. Under the direction of Borough President Robert F. Wagner, a tour of four East Side schools was made. Many parents had complained that the children were crowded to the point of being unable to get two in a seat, and that in some instances they had to squat on the floor until classes were called. The parents were justified in their complaints as all evidence of the tour of inspection had ended before the tour of inspection had ended. Conditions in Public School 19, located at Fourteenth Street, just west of Avenue A, were a "grotto." Built in 1857, the school looked its age. Rooms were crowded to $30,000 to $50,000, depending on their relative age. Indications are that the cost of constructing out-of-date structures will run into billions of dollars. The over-all picture of classrooms the overcrowding last year needed for public elementary and secondary schools, as given by the Office of Education, is as follows:
