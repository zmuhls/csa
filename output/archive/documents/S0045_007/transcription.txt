The Teacher Looks at the Administrator

We classroom teachers have known for a long time that if we are to have a good job of teaching, we must do a well-planned program of education. No matter how well-designed the courses of study may be, no matter how beautifully constructed the equipment, no matter how well prepared the teachers themselves, we cannot build a good school unless we have the kind of good citizenship America will demand of our children. Only good teachers have the unique and wonderful privilege of leading children to do good. We teachers have the opportunity to build, to kindle, to serve, to inspire, to lead children to grow in ways that will not only contribute to their happiness, day in and day out, but will contribute eventually to the advancement of our American democracy. We are accepting this challenge. We are learning to assume new responsibilities -- responsibilities that lie outside the classroom -- responsibilities to the school as a whole and to the community.

We are learning to be co-partners in formulating school policies. "We want to be co-partners in formulating school policies," says the teacher. "We are willing to examine the curricula and discuss with different people the materials that will help meet the growing needs of children with which we work." All these activities require time. We naturally look to give this time after the dismissal of class. But we want to live up to the requirements of our profession. We are learning to improve our lives and our work. We are experimenting with new ideas, with different techniques, with practical materials that will help meet the growing needs of children with which we work. All these activities require time. We naturally look to give this time after the dismissal of class. But we want to live up to the requirements of our profession.

In 1946, the teachers of the nation were instrumental in the creation of our National Commission on Teacher Education and Professional Standards. Since that time, through regional and national meetings, teachers have been working to improve their professional status. Here, with lay citizens, with parents, with school board members, we can improve teaching, pre-service training, standards. And this has been no study in theory alone. Around the nation, for the past several years, teachers have been applying higher standards to themselves. The percentage of teachers who now have bachelor's degrees in teacher education is greater than ever before. We naturally look to give this time after the dismissal of class. But we want to live up to the requirements of our profession.

What do we classroom teachers want? First of all, we want respect and admiration for our tasks, so that we may look to give this time after the dismissal of class. But we want to live up to the requirements of our profession. We are learning to improve our lives and our work. We are experimenting with new ideas, with different techniques, with practical materials that will help meet the growing needs of children with which we work. All these activities require time. We naturally look to give this time after the dismissal of class. But we want to live up to the requirements of our profession.

The percentage of teachers who now have bachelor's degrees in teacher education is greater than ever before. We naturally look to give this time after the dismissal of class. But we want to live up to the requirements of our profession.
