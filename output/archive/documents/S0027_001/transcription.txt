Public Confidence

A LARGE measure of our reward in teaching, another means by which we get what we earn, is to be found in the way our public expresses its confidence and surrounds us with the opportunity to make the most of it. The dollar is perhaps not unwisely the measure of public confidence in many American enterprises. Judged by that standard the teaching fraternity in New York State enjoys the confidence of its constituency. Our people believe in schools. They are able to support schools and they mean to do so. When the Unification Act was passed in 1904, the state was appropriating about $4,000,000 for public education annually, which was then about one-tenth of the total cost of maintaining the schools. This year the state will appropriate about $100,000,000 which will be roughly one-third of the cost of maintaining the schools. In other words, the state is appropriating twenty-five times as much as it did twenty-five years ago and is paying one-tenth rather than one-third of the total bill. This substitution of the wealth of the entire community of the state for the taxing unit of the community is the support of education in such large measure as an accomplishment which distinguishes our state in the nation.
