STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION. 63

COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM.

which the States of the Union have been slow to learn,
and which some of them will apparently never learn, that the
efficiency of a school system must necessarily depend largely
upon the extent of support, and the proper but complete exercise
of State authority. Men who understand it, not uncommonly lack
the courage to say so. The Empire State appreciated this fact early,
earlier than any other, and her statesmen, and her statesmen have
acted with wisdom and courage in the matter. Now, for many years,
the authority and power of the State have been freely exerted in
innumerable ways to the extension and betterment of school property,
and the improvement of the schools.

EXTENT AND MANNER OF SUPERVISION.

When New York first took action looking to the organization
of common schools, town commissioners with trustees in subdistricts
were provided for. When the time came to set about
reducing the disconnected schools, which under her aid and encouragement
had been organized in her cities and towns and along her
picturesque hillsides and valleys, into something like an organized
and related system, she did it through a general system of super-
visory officers, a plan which has since been put in operation in all
the States of the Union, but in the adoption of which she clearly
led the way.

In 1812, an act was passed providing for the appointment,
by the counsel of appointment, of a State Superintendent of Common
Schools. The same statute also provided for the election in each
town, at the annual town meeting, of three commissioners to super-
intend and manage the affairs of the schools within their town.
In 1814, this statute was reenacted with some amendments, among
which was a provision that there should also be chosen at each
town meeting "a suitable number of inhabitants not to exceed six,"
to act with the three commissioners as inspectors of common
schools.

Upon the office of Superintendent of Common Schools being
established, Gideon Hawley, then a young lawyer, and whom I
recollect as a pleasant and dignified old gentleman on the streets
of Albany sixty years later, was appointed to fill it. His vigor-
ous intellectual powers and his devotion to the duties of his posi-
tion, intellectual powers and his devotion to the duties of his posi-
tion, brought a steadily and compact system out of disorganization,
and gained for him a large share of public confidence and esteem.
