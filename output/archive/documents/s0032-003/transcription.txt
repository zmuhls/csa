ESTIMATED TAX RATE OF GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER PROPOSALS

FOR PERMANENT REDUCTION OF SCHOOL AID FORMULAS

Governor Rockefeller has submitted a series of eight bills which are designed to reduce state aid for schools on a permanent basis, beginning in the 1970-71 state fiscal year.

The impact of these proposals upon school district assessed valuation tax rates has been averaged for each county in New York State, outside New York City. An estimate has also been made of the total state aid loss for each county during a full school year. The figures shown below are derived from 1968-69 school year data.
