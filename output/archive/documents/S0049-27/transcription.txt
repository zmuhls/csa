**STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION.**

**NEW YORK LEADING THE NATION.**

Looking back over the field we cannot escape being impressed with the fact that New York has scarcely had full credit for the magnificent part she has borne in making the history of our common country. Few people, very few, have the leisure or the inclination for original research. The multitude are only too ready to take statements at second hand. It is commonly as helpful to the fame of a people to have had fervent poets, orators and historians among their sons, as to have performed the deeds which light the beacon fires of history.

No one can envy New England the historic facts, and they are radiant and innumerable, which are her honor and her glory. Much less can I. With an English ancestry who first found lodgment and built a home on the Massachusetts coast, before the seventeenth century had fairly turned its meridian, and before William Bradford and Miles Standish had gone to their eternal home, with my direct ancestor and at least two others of my blood and my name in the Massachusetts line when Lexington and Concord fired the shot "heard round the world," and Bunker Hill rang the Independence bell with a tone and a meaning it had never sounded before, it would be strange indeed if I was not jealous of all that belongs to the men and the women who first erected her civil and religious institutions, or those other men and women who in later years so heroically maintained and extended them. Their character, their beliefs and their acts laid the sure foundation of an imperishable fame which can never be shadowed or disparaged by giving others that credit which is their due.

The colony at New Amsterdam loved liberty as dearly and certainly, had as true a conception of the public institutions and regulations which guarantee civil and religious freedom as the colony at Plymouth. New York has contributed as liberally as New England to the material, as well as the intellectual development of the country.

If these observations are just in any sense, they are as related to the building up of a system of common schools. The first public school in America of which we have any knowledge was first maintained at Manhattan Island. The principle that all the property of a people should educate all the children of America is now maintained there. The oldest school in the city of New York was No. 248 West Seventy-fourth street in the Colony of New York that teachers were first required to be certified or licensed. New York was the first State in the Union to levy a general tax for the encouragement of elementary schools, as she was also the first to establish a permanent State Common School Fund. She was the first to specially establish State supervision of elementary schools, and she is now doing more for the education of teachers than any other. The institute system was first established in New York. She was the first to provide for the professional training of teachers in the State. The system was first established in New York. She was the first to provide for the professional training of teachers in the State. The system was first established in New York.
