b. Differences in the cost of the state foundation program arising from density of population shall be provided for in the state apportionment to any district by allowing a cost of living correction based upon the following formula: in any school district which has a population of more than ten thousand population according to the latest census of the United States and in any school district which has a population of more than forty-five hundred and is located in a county containing, or contiguous to, a city of more than fifty thousand population, one-half of one per- cent shall be added to the cost of the foundation program, as computed above, for each dollar that the average rental in such school district exceeds the average urban and non-farm rental for the state, exclusive of New York City, as determined by the latest census of the United States, except that such allowance shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the cost of the foundation program in any school district.

c. In computing the cost of the foundation program in school districts not provided for in subdivision "a," the following adjustments shall be made: (1) In any school district employing one teacher only, or in any district hav- ing a total average daily attendance of twenty-five or less, the average daily attendance shall be counted as sixteen; (2) In any school district employing two teachers only and having an average daily attendance in excess of twenty-five, the average daily attendance shall be counted as thirty-two; (3) In any school district not maintaining an approved academic department and employing three or more teachers, seventy-five dollars shall be allowed for each pupil in average daily attendance; (4) In any union free school district not otherwise provided for, eighty dollars shall be allowed for each pupil in average daily attendance as computed in subdivision "a."
