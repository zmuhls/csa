tendent of schools, a central rural school district, a central high school district,
or a union free school district meeting the standards adopted by the Board of Regents
for newly formed central rural school districts, the average daily attendance shall
be the sum of the following:

(1) The average daily attendance of pupils in approved kindergartens for which
the teacher is assigned a single class of such pupils for a full day and fifty per-
cent of such attendance in approved kindergartens for which the teacher is assigned
two classes of such pupils per day;

(2) The average daily attendance of pupils in grades one through six, and the
average daily attendance of pupils in grades seven and eight in districts not main-

hereinafter provided for;

(3) One and a third times the average daily attendance in grades seven and
above in approved secondary schools, exclusive of attendance in special classes
hereinafter provided for, except that average daily attendance in summer high
schools, continuation, or part-time schools shall be computed according to the ratio
that the total number of hours that each such school is in session during the year
bears to five times the number of days in the full legal term as defined in this
chapter;

(4) An average daily attendance of twenty-seven for each approved special class,
organized under sections five hundred and seventy-nine and ten hundred and twenty

class is nine or fewer, an average daily attendance of three shall be allowed for
each pupil in average daily attendance in such class; and

(5) The average daily attendance in a night elementary school for adults or a
night high school for youth and adults multiplied by the ratio that the total num-
ber of hours that such school is in session during the year bears to five times the
number of days in the full legal term as defined by this chapter.
