A PAPER BY SAMUEL THURBER, A.M.,  

who hold these views concerning social classification have, with apparent propriety, been called "orientalists," as seeming to be willing to introduce something like a system of caste. Until further statements of their peculiar views are made, I must leave it unsettled whether they merit so offensive an epithet. Sometimes the critic charges us with leveling all minds down to our preconceived standard of what is possible. Some school officers have acknowledged this, and have endeavored to loosen somewhat the rigid bonds of strict grading. We ought not to look for release from criticism, so long as we thwart nature with our programmes. Competency, resolution, fidelity in pupils have their rights. Incompetency and feebleness of will demand our regard, but they have no right to ask ability and energy to wait. Education is a business affair. The school is kept to accomplish the most possible good for the public: that is, to develop each child so as its capacity allows.  

We err greatly in assuming that every young man and woman should go to school as long as possible. For many, it is a real misfortune to have their school opportunity abridged. But for many others it is equally a misfortune to be kept at school too long. We fail to exercise discrimination. There comes a time when the boy or girl should finally stop going to school. Hence, I doubt not much "pedagogic energy" is wasted, much money wasted, much odium incurred. The work of the high school is of a strain too ambitious to be useful to some of the pupils who go through the form of doing it. It would seem too much like an attempt to gather up into a hurried three or four years all the possible education not already imparted. The course needs simplifying. I think the critics are right in their strictures upon the high school work as abounding in promise more than in achievement. In making the improvements which I indicate, we need the help of the critics; for the course of high school studies is not our handiwork, and we have to sacrifice no personal pride in seeing it changed. It is the result of accretions made without skill and wisdom under the influence of public sentiment. Some generous impulses, some whims of men in authority, the pride of communities,—these have made the high school chaotic. No principles prevail. The situation is not reassuring.  

Of course the end and aim of all public schools is good citizenship; and the end and aim of the high school is still good citizenship. Here is a principle, or even contented. No ignorant citizenship is likely to be good, vigilant public spirit which makes the citizen in our Republic good. The lower schools cannot communicate the touch of intellectual secondary schools and the colleges are really the hope of the Nation. These schools are, all about us, ready at hand, but sadly wandering from their destiny. Can we not and the critics impress public opinion so that it shall fulfillment alone will raise them above criticism?  

Dr. Samuel Johnson was, on occasion, unmerciful in his plainness of speech towards Goldsmith; but he would never allow a disrespectful word
