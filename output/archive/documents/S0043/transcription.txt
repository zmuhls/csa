**Schools--Major Problem in Area Suburbs**  
*Cost of New Building Nears $20 Million As 'Kid Crop' Jams Present Structures*  
By William E. Rowley  

The touchiest subject in the suburban and rural country around Albany is schools. Mention the word to a suburbanite or countryman and you'll draw a warm response. Their sensitivity, which is difficult for a city dweller to understand, is due to two big problems: the need to get many new large schools built fast, and the heavy increase in school enrollments is bulging the walls of the one-room schoolhouse.  

The school district that is faring somewhat similarly around Albany is just the growing pains of a development that's taking place around most U.S. cities. The planners, trying hard but not always in failure to get schools built, built, built, are being pressed by the taxpayers who are likely to pay for the schools. The scattered "nights" are sometimes healthy signs of democratic opposition and serve as a brake on the builders' speed and school. But the offer they have slowed down the big building job that is already late. Next year there will be more children in crowded improvised classrooms like the one-room schoolhouse.  

Trying to get a better look at the rate of the builders' speed at this rate of the race of the builders is bulging the walls of the one-room schoolhouse. The Knickerbocker News reports that the new big central schools being built in the countryside around Albany are going to replace a lot of one-room schools like the one, the McKowville Branch School on Farnham Road.  

**THE PASSING ONE-ROOM SCHOOL**

**$2 Million Fight Goes to 'Referee'**  
The fight over a $1,500,000 senior high school project in Delmar will be brought before the voters of the district on April 14. A. Willis, chairman of the district's Board of Education, will conduct a hearing at 2 p.m. inst. to get the approval of opposition leaders in the district who have appealed a Board decision to go ahead with the project.  

**High School Project**  
The high school project in Columbia County Central School District is the next step in the suburban development of the district. It is aimed to relieve the overcrowding and opposition leaders have declared defeated last spring. The board found that only a simple majority vote is needed to pass the $20 million mark by 1960.

**North Colony Plan**

Another three-part elementary school is now being planned in the area. After the North Colony Central District, the Board of Education and opposition leaders will have to find a site next year for a new kindergarten-sixth grade district in the Rosselle area. Another big $1,500,000, senior high school is being planned in Delmar, depending on how the vote on the project this spring will be. It is expected to be completed by September, 1954.

But leaders of an opposition group, the Citizens Association, have appealed to the commissioner of education to call a new vote. They have urged instead of the proposed new vote that the present high school be retained.

Other Needs

Besides these projects, in the Rensselaer County area, there are some growing outlying districts farther out, where a 10-room elementary school is needed. The Lake Central District, for example, has a 10-room elementary school at the end of the Hackett Blvd. extension in Delmar for 420 pupils. The district is planning to build a new elementary school for 210 pupils.

The high school problem has been heavy. While it is included in the Menands district, the only one confronting the Menands Problem while it is included in the Menands district has been heavy.

Groups Recommendations

The committee recommends construction of a new school on the site of the old elementary school building in the Menands district. The building is one of the most bitter fights the district has had.

**Here and There You'll Find One Bell Tolling for One-Room Schools**

By William E. Rowley

The "Country School of Tomorrow" is finished. This is how the new South Colony Central District will look when it is completed this summer. The sketch was made by Ryder & Link, Schenectady architects. The school will be at the end of Hackett Blvd. between the Albany and Sand Creek Rd.

Many Mergers Helped Districts Economize

The school building demands in the southern sections of Rensselaer County and southern Schenectady County have been met by the consolidation of several former districts.

THE PASSING ONE-ROOM SCHOOL—The big new central schools being rushed into construction in the countryside around Albany are going to replace a lot of one-room schools like this one, the McKownville Branch School on Johnson Rd. A new Guilderland Central elementary school is scheduled to be started in construction next fall to take its pupils.

CRAMPED FOR SPACE—Inside the one-room McKownville Branch School there's not much room to move around. Mrs. Mary Mabie is shown with her class during a study period.
