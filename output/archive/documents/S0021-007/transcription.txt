HIGH SCHOOL CONGRESS
OF THE
STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION.

W. K. WICKES, Principal of Syracuse High School, Chairman.
G. A. LEWIS, Secretary.

PREFATORY NOTE.

The word "Congress" is here advisedly chosen instead of "Section," for if a play upon words be admissible in so sober and even grave a document as an educational programme or prospectus, I may say that it is far better for a company of teachers to "step together" along the highway of education, than to "cut up" or be "cut up" or "cut off."

Moreover, the word "Congress" suggests the coming together of representative citizens—as teachers surely ought to be—for the discussion of questions of serious concern. At such a time even slight adherence to the forms of a Congress is of advantage—leading, as it may, to a direct vote upon any question.

Therefore, it is hoped that any member of the H. S. C. of the S. T. A. will feel "free to speak his mind" upon any topic in the list, in so far as time may permit, after the duly appointed speakers shall have finished.

3. A RESOLUTION
Resolved, That we recommend to the State Department of Public Instruction the establishment of a Department of Educational Economy, for the purpose of diffusing among the public school teachers of the Empire State all possible practical information on the following great educational subjects:

LABOR — The Pupil.
CAPITAL — The Teacher.
THE WORKSHOP — The School.
RAW MATERIAL — Text-Books.
TOOLS — Brains.
THE PRODUCT — Knowledge.

FRIDAY MORNING, JULY 2, 10 O'CLOCK.

1. The Art of Expression.
What Kind of Books to Read.—Supt. J. G. RIGGS, of Plattsburgh.
The Place and Use of Essay Writing.—PROF. BRAINARD KELLOGG, of Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn.
The Teaching of Public Speaking in the Secondary Schools.—PROF. DUNCAN C. LEE, of Cornell University.

2. A TRIPLE RESOLUTION.
Whereas, in matters educational, the present time is one of constant agitation, experimentation, and change, therefore:
Resolved (1). That we are in danger, in our modern practice as teachers, of ignoring certain old-time, fundamental principles of education.
PRESIDENT RAYMOND, of Union College.

Resolved (2). That the spirit of radicalism, in the things of education, threatens the overthrow of a temperate, wise conservatism therein.
PRESIDENT SCHURMAN, of Cornell University.

Resolved (3). That through adherence to the "letter" of examinations, mark- ings, and various arbitrary requirements, the public schools of the land are in danger of losing the true "spirit" of education.
CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER, LL.D.
