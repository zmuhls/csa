RADIO CAMPAIGN FOR INCREASED STATE AID

During next week (week of March 17) the Association is conducting a "blitz" radio campaign covering Upstate New York and Long Island using over 500 airings of 30-second spot announcements over some 100 stations. Local associations can supplement our efforts by buying additional spots on any of the stations listed.

Just call the station, ask for the radio sales department, refer to the State Association and tell them your Association would like to supplement an order by whatever number you can afford.

Teachers Association spots (there are two different ones) and tell them your Association would like to supplement an order by whatever number you can afford.
