DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.

"The affairs of all school districts would be managed with business
system, an advantage which now attaches to union free school districts,
"where a school board has charge of the district, holding regular meetings
"and having an oversight over school interests;
"Equalization of school taxes in town;
"A more efficient, intelligent and progressive class of school officers;
"All the inhabitants of a town would receive equal educational adv-
"antages at equal rates;
"Fewer and larger schools, better wages, better teachers;
"More and better supervision;
"Better facilities for grading the country schools, and establishing a
"uniform and satisfactory course of study, having in view the entire school
"population of a town; advanced or high schools could be established at
"convenient points, which every pupil of the town of requisite educational
"advancement would have the right to attend;
"Cheaper schools, lower taxes, longer terms for less money;
"Greater dignity would attach to public education in the common
"schools of the state; public opinion would have greater respect for it, and
"public pride would be aroused;
"Cheaper text-books would be possible;
"The law in reference to compulsory education would be more generally
"and more easily enforced;
"It is the only system which will save the small country districts from
"extinction;
"More permanency in the teaching force of the state; a firm step to
"ward making the teachers' profession permanent;
"As a result of the last point, a better and higher grade of teachers;
"Better facilities for instruction would be afforded in the way of appa-
"ratus, books of reference, etc, and more intelligent action would be
"taken in reference to the equipment, maintenance and preservation of
"school district libraries and public libraries;
"A general uplifting of educational sentiment throughout the State,
"When we enter into a full realization of the benefits of the system the
"state can say of every pupil that completes the course of study as said
"the knight in Hudibras:

"He knows what's what,
And that's as high
As metaphysic wit can fly."

PRINCIPAL CHENEY, of Cortland: It seems to me that such an ad-
mirable paper as this ought not to go without some commendation. It
seems to me likewise that this is a very serious question, and we shall not
arrive at a better condition of things until the passage of the township bill.
It seems to me that in the decreasing numbers of our rural schools the only
remedy that we can find is that suggested by the township bill, when those
schools may be united and come under the common head and thereby obtain
capable teachers; so that as teachers of the state bill until it shall be passed.
