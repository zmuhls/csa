HAVE YOU BEEN A VICTIM OF ABUSE OF POWER by the New York City board of education.

There is a history of abuse of power in PS 380 using children. There were acts of emotional abuse, manipulating, intimidating, threatening to parents. Acts of calling the police, (ACS) children's protective services, EMS, sending children to psychiatric hospital, suspension, setting children up against them for malicious intent, bullying, lack of concern, verbal abuse, teasing, harassing, targeting Black, Brown and Hispanic families.

Children were targeted in PS 380 for many years. Parents reached out to the Board of Education for help and each time they complained it was overlooked. Because of abuse of power in PS 380 children became fearful and did not trust anyone. Our children are victims, they feel like no one is listening to them or believe them. This is done by the staff so that they would feel isolated and alone.

If you, your child or anyone you may know were a victim of abuse of power in New York City public schools. If you have experienced great emotional strain that caused difficulties in your life. You may be entitled to civil Rights against the board of education.
