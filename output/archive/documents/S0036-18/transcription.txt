Announcement for 1927-28

fully consider the reasons why it is their duty to join our organization.

1. Because group and class organization is now considered absolutely necessary and the New York State Teachers' Association is the only inclusive organization of the State. This is the only organization possible only by the co-operation of all the teachers of the State. Nothing big or important can be accomplished in these days except through organization and co-operation. If the teachers of New York State are to perform all their duties and functions as teachers, they must have a strong and active organization functioning as a State unit.

2. Because it helps in a professional way. The zone or district meetings will furnish excellent programs on professional topics. Educational problems will be discussed by experts. Inspiring addresses will be delivered by great leaders. Our Journal goes to all members ten times a year to keep them informed concerning the problems, program and activities of the Association. The spirit de corps thus developed in the teachers' welfare enables them to work more happily and efficiently.

No teacher can afford to stay outside. When we have 100% in our membership, we shall be able to secure any and all reasonable consideration for the teachers' welfare. But we must be ready to secure any and all reasonable consideration for the teachers' welfare. But we must be ready to the demand for more money for teaching. But we must be ready with strong organization to meet it.

Attendance at the meetings promotes closer acquaintance and good fellowship among teachers who are otherwise widely separated. It pays to rub elbows with our fellow workers. Many of our best teachers holding the highest positions attribute their rise in the profession to their wide acquaintance with teachers in general and their close acquaintance with educational leaders in general and their close acquaintance with educational leaders.
