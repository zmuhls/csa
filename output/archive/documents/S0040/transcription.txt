Are We
Cheating Our Children?

by giving them educational tools inferior to those we enjoyed.

Successive waves of war and postwar systems lagging at least two decades behind needed—and neglected—construction.

YOUR COMMUNITY IS IN TROUBLE.
Every community is heading for the gravest crisis the United States has ever faced. Unless measures are taken to cope with the actual short of actual war, unless we can provide educational facilities adequate to the needs of our children, we will be faced with a situation that will be as serious as the traffic jams in secondary schools that have been caused by the postwar babies. The postwar babies are deluging public schools at least two decades behind construction. Few schools have been built since the last war, and the few that have been built have been behind the needs of the community. In the early depression-ridden 1930s, few schools were built during the new school construction period. In the 1940s, the war effort took priority on materials for school construction. In the 1950s, the postwar babies are deluging public schools at least two decades behind construction.

In the 1950s, the postwar babies are deluging public schools at least two decades behind construction. Few schools have been built since the last war, and the few that have been built have been behind the needs of the community.

The bald facts in the case are as follows: The United States is producing children about three times faster than we are providing educational facilities for them. It must come as a shock to learn that hundreds of thousands of kids are attending schools in tents, sheds, basements, stores, churches, garages, trailers, and other makeshift facilities. The structure of our public education, already sagging under the impact of the postwar babies, is now in danger of collapsing completely. The money is so desperately needed in the public schools that the financial considerations are no longer a question of whether we can afford to build new schools, but whether we can afford to keep the schools we have.

The money is so desperately needed in the public schools that the financial considerations are no longer a question of whether we can afford to build new schools, but whether we can afford to keep the schools we have.

The worst crisis in our public schools can be predicted as a direct result of the postwar babies. There were 3,900,000 children born in the United States in 1951. We have an astronomical chart of the courses of events that will be faced by the United States in the next seven years. We will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events. If we do not build these classrooms, we will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events. If we do not build these classrooms, we will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events. If we do not build these classrooms, we will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events.

tain adequate accommodations and to meet rising enrollments," says Dr. Ray L. Hammond, chief of the school housing section of the U.S. Office of Education. "We're erecting only about 40,000 classrooms, less than half enough to meet current needs. In the next ten years, we're going deeper into the hole all the time." Dr. Hammond points out that his estimate of 600,000 classrooms barely covers minimum requirements achieved. Even if that figure is at the present satisfactory, the odds are all against it. A 54 per cent increase between 1900 and 1920 was put to a nasty habit of becoming obsolete much faster than residential and office buildings. Few classrooms in old schoolhouses are large enough to practice progressions in extremely valuable methods of education. (Years ago classrooms averaged 500 square feet. Today, the recommended minimum is 1,000 square feet.) Few of the older high schools are properly equipped for social studies and science courses which are practically mandatory in this electronic age. Were yet one out of every five schoolhouses unsafe, according to the U.S. Office of Education. But for the last three generations, the times have continued in operation for years to come to become better than no school at all.

These statistics must be awfully discouraging to citizens who just have shelved out large tax assessments for schools in thousands of communities. More schools were built in 1950 than any other year in our history. A total of 4,520 public schools were constructed at a cost of $1,251,478,000 in 1950. In addition, 166 private schools costing $22,333,259 were erected. We had so far to go, however, that the conclusive effort did nothing to relieve the situation today as we were two years later in large measure, to the cutbacks in materials earmarked for military purposes. There were 5,124 new schools planned for 1951, but Dr. Walter D. Cocking, editor of The School Executive, a journal dealing with administrative problems, that work has been begun on fewer than one-third of that number—we discuss presently the Defense and we'll discuss presently the Defense.

For fifteen years we found all sorts of excuses to delay school building programs. Money was not available during the 1930s that could have been used for school construction unhindered by restrictions. There were 5,250 classrooms added to the national pool. That means $4,240 classrooms were added to the national pool. According to Dr. Hammon, however, about 85,000 classrooms are needed. In other words, our best effort was not good enough.

The evidence is irrefutable that we are offering our children the best of our educational tools to the exclusion of those we enjoyed. We are rearing our children as parents and citizens. Since there can be no substitute for an educated, enlightened electorate as the backbone of a democracy, we are sacrificing, in effect, the nation's future.

However, whether rearmament is so overwhelming in its demands that it should virtually hamstring the system of government will make them realize the ideals they need to concentrate even in the face of the atomic weapon. Attempts to reduce overcrowding by splitting sessions is hardly a happy solution. The "swing shift" has unsettled the family. Dr. Horace Mann called school the first line of defense. That was true a century ago. Today, when wars are fought by missiles, when the atomic weapon is our maximum objective, not save for any real estate or spheres of economic importance, the facts they need to make a democratic system of government will work. Homesteads, Manna, and the atomic weapon are all the same. The swing shift is unsettling of the family. Dr. W. T. Woodson, division superintendent of the Fairfax County, Va., just across the river from Washington, brought the problem painfully close to the Congress. In the winter of 1927, the instant year period ended September 1st, 1927. To remedy the situation, the school year was extended from 505 to 1927. The school year was extended from 505 to 1927.
