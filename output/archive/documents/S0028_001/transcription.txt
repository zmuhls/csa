APPORTIONMENT OF MONIES APPROPRIATED FOR THE SUPPORT OF COMMON SCHOOLS  

1. The financial support of the school districts shall be a joint responsibility of the school districts and of the state. The school districts shall pay an amount equivalent to the computed dollars of actual valuation, as heretofore defined, toward the support of the state foundation program. The state shall apportion and pay to the school districts the remainder, subject to the provisions of this section.  
a. Stability in state apportionments for the support of the state foundation program shall be maintained by spreading over a period of years any increase or decrease in the apportionment to any district in any year caused by changes in average daily attendance or actual valuation or both. The apportionment to any school district for any year shall not vary by more than two percent of the apportionment for the preceding year as a result of changes in average daily attendance, actual valuation, or both.  
b. The increase in the apportionment to any school district in any year due solely to the passage of this section shall not exceed ten percent of the apportionment solely to the passage of this section shall not exceed ten percent of the apportionment to any school district in any year under this section shall not be less than the amount that would have been apportioned under the laws in effect on July 1, 1942 except as provided in subdivision "a" above.  
c. The apportionment to any school district in any year under this section shall not be less than the amount that would have been apportioned under the laws in effect on July 1, 1942 except as provided in subdivision "a" above.  

2. The state foundation program for a school district is defined as the sum of the computed cost of average daily attendance, as determined in subdivision (a) the computed cost of average daily attendance, as determined in subdivision three of this section, and (b) the computed cost of transportation as determined by the computed cost of transportation as determined by the computed cost of transportation as determined by the computed cost of transportation as determined by the computed cost of transportation as determined by the computed cost of transportation as determined by the
