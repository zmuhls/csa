**Observing Horace Mann’s Birthday May 4**  
*A Public Relations Project for Local Education Associations*  

This unit consists of five parts: this page of suggestions, a page of quotations from the writings of Horace Mann, a portrait, a brief sketch of his life, and references to every schoolchild and every citizen who should know the life and work of Horace Mann as he knows the lives of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. Without the foundations laid in free public schools by Horace Mann and his contemporaries, which Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln could hardly have endured, the work of the other statements of democratic government and patriots could hardly have endured. As Jefferson said, Horace Mann was the pioneer philosopher of democratic education. His writings are unsurpassed for their clarity and their scope in dealing with the whole range of educational problems. The season of the year offers an opportunity to acquaint the young people in the community and citizens of the community with the important phase of our American history that has to do with the development of free public schools.  

Horace Mann was born May 4, 1796. Special occasions for that day or for a convenient occasion may well be arranged that day within the school week nearest it. The observance may be planned and carried out by the public relations committee of the local education association or by some special committee or person assigned to the public relations activity of your local education association and the schools it serves. The observance may be called a regular annual activity of your local education association and the schools it serves.
